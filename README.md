# PyBer_Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## 1.Overview of the analysis: 
    am assigned to do an analyiz on data in some very large CSV files for V.Isualize who is a formmer programmer who started math works and a co-founderfor PyBer , I'll be collectiong the data that i need and write Python codes using Panda's libraries ,Jupyter and Matplotlib to create charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of the drivers and rides,as well as the precentage of total fares,rides and drivers by type of city from January to May 2019 combined with charts and plots that visualize each.
## 2.Results:
    after analysing the whole data we can see clearly the diffrence in ride_sharing data in each type of city (Urban , Suburban , Rural) defenitly there is huge gab between the Urban areas and the other two (Suburban , Rural) because of the population diffrences ,size of the area and defentily the need to use the car ,so lets display some of the outputs that we got after analysing the given data :
#. total drivers by each city
