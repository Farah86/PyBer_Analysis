# PyBer_Analysis
## 1.Overview of the analysis: 
am assigned to do an analyiz on data in some very large CSV files for V.Isualize who is a formmer programmer who started math works and a co-founderfor PyBer , I'll be collectiong the data that i need and write Python codes using Panda's libraries ,Jupyter and Matplotlib to create charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of the drivers and rides,as well as the precentage of total fares,rides and drivers by type of city from January to May 2019 combined with charts and plots that visualize each.

## 2.Results:
after analysing the whole data we can see clearly the diffrence in ride_sharing data in each type of city (Urban , Suburban , Rural) defenitly there is huge gab between the Urban areas and the other two (Suburban , Rural) because of the population diffrences ,size of the area and defentily the need to use the car ,so lets display some of the outputs that we got after analysing the given data :

#.total drivers by each city

#.total fares for each city

#.PyBer summary DataFrame for all (rides,drivers,fares)for each city

so apperantly the Urban got more drivers more cars and defently gonna have more Fares($) with all the population amount unlike the case in the (suburban and rural) and especially the rural which have less population and defently no need for many drivers ...

## 3.Summary:
Based on the results , we got the idea of how the diffrences between all the cities and how the Urban comes in the top of the list of the highest fares($39,854.38	),the highest amount of drivers (2,405),and the total rides (1,625) .
while Suburban comes in the middle of the list and the least is Rural by total fares ($4,327.93	) , (78)driver only and the total rides would be (125) which is a huge diffrent maybe in the future we can encourge the people who live the Urbans to visit and explore all the places in the Rural or even the Suburban especially when we notice that most of the rides in all the cites rise when we get closer to the warm weather months in March and April.....
